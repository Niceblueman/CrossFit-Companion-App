# **CrossFit Companion  App**

_Tagline: Your ultimate guide to CrossFit workouts._


## **Team**



* **Sakina N.**: 
    * Project Manager (Has experience in managing projects and will oversee the project from start to finish)
    * Quality Assurance (Will test the app for bugs and ensure it meets quality standards)
* **Abdelkarim O.**: 
    * Lead Developer (Has extensive experience in app development and will lead the coding efforts)
    * UI/UX Designer (Has a keen eye for design and will ensure the app is user-friendly)


## **Technologies**



* React Native (for cross-platform mobile app development)
* Firebase (for backend services like authentication and database)
* Figma (for UI/UX design)

**Technology Comparison**



* **Choice**: React Native
* **Alternative**: Flutter
* **Reason for Choice**: React Native allows us to write code once and use it across multiple platforms. It also has a larger community and more third-party libraries compared to Flutter.


## **Challenge**

**Problem to Solve**: Many people want to do CrossFit workouts but don’t know where to start or how to do the exercises correctly.

**What the Project Will Not Solve**: This app will not replace a personal trainer or medical advice.

**Target Users**: Individuals interested in CrossFit workouts, from beginners to advanced athletes.

**Locale Relevance**: This app can be used by anyone around the world. It’s not locale-specific.


## **Risks**

**Technical Risks**: One risk is that third-party libraries we plan to use become deprecated or unsupported. We’ll mitigate this by choosing popular, well-maintained libraries and having a backup plan.

**Non-Technical Risks**: Users might find the app too complicated or not user-friendly. We’ll mitigate this by conducting user testing and gathering feedback regularly.


## **Infrastructure**

**Branching and Merging Strategy**: We’ll use the GitHub flow strategy, creating new branches for features/bugs, then merging them into the main branch after review.

**Deployment Strategy**: We plan to deploy our app on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

**Data Population Strategy**: We’ll populate our app with a variety of CrossFit workouts, which we’ll source from certified CrossFit trainers.

**Testing Tools and Processes**: We’ll use Jest for unit testing and Detox for end-to-end testing. We’ll also conduct manual testing regularly.


## **Existing Solutions**

**Similar Products or Solutions**



1. **CrossFit Games App**: Similar in that it provides CrossFit workouts, but it’s mainly focused on the annual CrossFit Games competition.
2. **WOD Roulette**: Provides random CrossFit workouts, but lacks a structured program for beginners.

Our app will stand out by providing structured workout programs suitable for all levels, with detailed instructions and video demonstrations for each exercise.
